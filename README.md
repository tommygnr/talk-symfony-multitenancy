###Abstract
According to Wikipedia, multitenancy is a software architecture in which a single instance of a software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance including its data, configuration, user management, etc.

Handling multitenancy in a Symfony2 application raises interesting challenges. Obviously, keeping tenant data segregated is of the utmost importance but it is also important to maintain developer productivity and application performance. Drawing on his experience in developing multiple multitenant Symfony2 applications Tom will discuss the different approaches he has taken,
discussing the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and then examine in detail the current approach he uses and why he considers it the optimal approach.

I will add a link to the compiled slides here after I have delivered the talk
